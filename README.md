A salary management database structure includes tables such as employee, department, and salary, each with specific columns representing attributes such as name, job title, salary, and department ID. 
The primary key for the employee table would be the employee ID, and the department table would have a primary key of department ID. 
A foreign key would link the employee and department tables. 
Indexes would be created on columns frequently searched, such as employee name or department name. 
Constraints would ensure data consistency and accuracy, such as ensuring that only valid department IDs are entered. 
The structure would allow for efficient data retrieval and management of employee salary information.
